# Generate TV Scripts


### Project Overview

In this project, we'll generate our own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs. We'll be using a dataset of Seinfeld scripts. 

The Neural Network that we will build will generate a new, "fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in the training data.

### The Data
The dataset We'll be using is called [Seinfeld Chronicles](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) and contains TV scripts from 9 seasons of [Seinfeld TV show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld)
